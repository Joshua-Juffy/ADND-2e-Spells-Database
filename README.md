# ADND-2e-Spells-Database
A database with most spells from ADND 2e, as well as specializations and sphere's of influence of Arcadia. 

The main table is Spells, which contains all relevent infromation of 885 wizard and cleric spells from ADND 2nd edition.

Those spells can be joined with Specilizations, Opposed_specilizations, Spell_Specilizations, Deity_Sphere_Access, Sphere and Deiety to generate lists of spells a player character can learn. 

Show 2e Spells runs a very basic program that returns a list of spells based on specilization/dieity.
